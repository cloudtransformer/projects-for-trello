Projects for Trello
===========
[Projects for Trello](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/projects-for-trello/mholjhodapabhdbchonjjoecmfhobfoa)
adds functionality to the awesome trello.com for use in multiple project boards.

Setup
-----
Projects for Trello is a Chrome extension and you can install it via the Chrome Webstore or clone this
repository and load the Projects for Trello folder as an unpacked extension.

How does it work?
-----------------
Projects for Trello is a Chrome Extension that adds a little bit of functionality
to Trello.com to make it perfect to use with multiple projects. Projects for Trello
allows you to add project labels to cards.

Project names are written in between braces in the title of a card.
For example: {Project} Upon an error I want to see an awesome 404 page.
Upon saving the card, Projects for Trello picks up the assigned project name and shows it
as a badge in the lower left corner of the card. Projects for Trello also supports multiple labels per card.
