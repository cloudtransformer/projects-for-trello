		<h2>Projects for Trello Chrome Extension Help</h2>
		<p>
			Projects for Trello is a Chrome Extension that adds a little bit of functionality
			to Trello.com to make it perfect to use with multiple projects. Projects for Trello
			allows you to add project labels to cards.
		</p>
		<h3>Adding project labels to a card</h3>
		<p>
			Project names are written in between parentheses in the title of a card.
			<code>{Project} Upon an error I want to see an awesome 404 page.</code>
			Upon saving the card, Projects for Trello picks up the assigned project name and shows it
			as a badge in the lower left corner of the card.
