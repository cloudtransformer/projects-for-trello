    <h2>Projects for Trello Chrome Extension Help</h2>
    <p>
      Projects for Trello is a Chrome Extension that adds a little bit of functionality
      to Trello.com to make it perfect to use with multiple projects. Projects for Trello
      allows you to add project labels to cards.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding project labels to a card</h3>
    <p>
      Project names are written in between parentheses in the title of a card.
      <code>{Project} Upon an error I want to see an awesome 404 page.</code>
      Upon saving the card, Projects for Trello picks up the assigned project name and shows it
      as a badge in the lower left corner of the card. Then hides the project name from the card title.
